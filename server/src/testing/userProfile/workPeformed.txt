We have tested the following endpoints

router.put('/user/profile')
router.get('/user/profile')

We have used the test user created in the register user page Note:

An authorization token has to be appended when making the request to test the endpoint.

1.  The user profile is updated when user makes changes.
    Refer to userProfile.tsx

2. The user profile is returned to the user.
    Refer to userProfile.tsx
